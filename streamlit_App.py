## Document Genie: Get instant insights from your Documents

This chatbot is built using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, leveraging Google's Generative AI model Gemini-PRO. It processes uploaded PDF documents by breaking them down into manageable chunks, creates a searchable vector store, and generates accurate answers to user queries. This advanced approach ensures high-quality, contextually relevant responses for an efficient and effective user experience.

### How It Works

Follow these simple steps to interact with the chatbot:

1. *Enter Your API Key*: You'll need a Google API key for the chatbot to access Google's Generative AI models. Obtain your API key https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey.

2. *Upload Your Documents*: The system accepts multiple PDF files at once, analyzing the content to provide comprehensive insights.

3. *Ask a Question*: After processing the documents, ask any question related to the content of your uploaded documents for a precise answer.

    Step 1: Identify Key Concepts
    - List all key concepts mentioned in the question.
    - Separate these concepts into those likely to be in the context and those that might be irrelevant or incorrect.
    

    Step 2: Scan the Context
    - Search the context for information related to each key concept from Step 1.
    - Note which concepts are present and which are absent in the context.
    

    Step 3: Find Nearest Relevant Information
    - For concepts present in the context, identify the most relevant information.
    - For concepts not directly mentioned, find the closest related information in the context.
    

    Step 4: Address Misconceptions
    - Identify any misconceptions in the question based on the context.
    - Prepare to correct these misconceptions using information from the context.
    

    Step 5: Formulate the Answer
    - Start by addressing any misconceptions or incorrect assumptions.
    - Provide information on the concepts present in the context, even if they differ from what was asked.
    - Explain why certain asked concepts are not applicable, if relevant.
    - Use the nearest relevant information for concepts not directly addressed in the context.
    

    Step 6: Summarize and Clarify
    - Provide a clear summary of the correct information from the context.
    - Explicitly state which parts of the question could not be answered from the given context.
   

    Step 7: Generate a final answer 
    -give a final answer based on step 6 and return the answer

    Remember:
    - Do not invent or assume information not provided.
